# All sensitive-data entries must be filled in with:
# description:  A description of the sensitive data.
# category:     The category of the sensitive data. List of categories is present in [Classification of PII by categories](https://sequra.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3880026161/Sensitive+data+classification+guide#Classification-of-PII-by-categories) page.
# expiration:   The expiration date of the sensitive data, NEVER if it never expires.
# comment:      Any additional information about the sensitive data. (This is an optional field.)
# storage:      The storage where the sensitive data is stored.
# storage_details: The specific details for the storage used. This field is a map of key-value pairs.

# Note that this should be filled for production environments only.

# For each `storage_details` entry, the following fields must be filled in, depending on the storage type:
# - For `database` storage:
#   - name: The name of the database where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - table: The table where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - column: The column where the sensitive data is stored.
#
# - For `s3` storage:
#   - bucket: The bucket where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - key_prefix: The bucket key prefix, meaning the folder in which the sensitive data is located.
#
# - For `elasticsearch` storage:
#   - cluster_name: The name of the elasticsearch cluster where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - index_name: The name of the index where the sensitive data is stored. In case of using aliasses for the index, the alias name should be used.
#   - field: The field where the sensitive data is stored. In case of nested fields, the full path should be used.
#
# - For `redis` storage:
#   - cluster_name: The name of the redis cluster where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - key: The key where the sensitive data is stored.
#
# Note that adding sensitive data to observability tooling is not recommended.
# Cleaning up and handling expirations is extremely expensive since information gets replicated and backed-up in multiple destinations.
# If you need to add sensitive data to observability tooling, please ensure you have a good reason.
# We encourage you to use different data to identify the information in the observability tooling, for instance, order identifiers.
#
# - For `observability-logs` storage:
#   - field: The field where the sensitive data is stored. In case of nested fields, the full path should be used.
#   - query: The query used to retrieve the sensitive data.
#
# - For `observability-metrics` storage:
#   - key: The key where the sensitive data is stored.
#
# - For `observability-traces` storage:
#   - service: The service name where the sensitive data is stored.
#   - operation: The operation where the sensitive data is stored.
